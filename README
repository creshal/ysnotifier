# Minimal GTK2 based daemon/consumer for FDO compliant desktop notifications

Spec: http://developer.gnome.org/notification-spec/

Test suite compliance:

	test-action-icons:       0% Action icons not supported
	test-basic:            100% OK (long notifications are cut -- not strictly specification compliant, but acceptable in most cases)
	test-default-action:   100% OK
	test-error:            100% OK (since the test doesn't do anything but showing a notification)
	test-image:             50% stock OK, URI not supported
	test-markup:           100% OK
	test-multiple-actions: 100% OK
	test-persistence:        0% Persistence not supported
	test-removal:          100% OK
	test-replace:          100% OK
	test-replace-widget:   100% OK
	test-resident:           0% Persistence not supported
	test-rtl:              100% OK
	test-server-info:      100% OK
	test-size-change:        0% other notifications not adjusted for new size
	test-transient:       (100%) Persistence not supported, therefore automatically transient
	test-urgency:            0% Urgency not supported
	test-xy                100%
	test-xy-actions:       100%
	text-xy-stress:        100%
	total:                  73%
